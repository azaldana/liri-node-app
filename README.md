## Description

LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDb for movies. If no song is provided in your search for spotify then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base. If the user doesn't type a movie in the search for OMDb, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'
